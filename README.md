# Digital-Image-Processing-Animated-Blur
### ITCS 6134 - Digital Image Processing Project
This repository is for a project in which I created an animated blur on a video based on a file path, dimensions, start, and end time of a blurring box. Note: The initial demo video is too large to put on Github, however any video (preferably < 10 mins) should work if the correct filepath is passed in.
